# iCompare

##### This is a web app in which we compare apple products from amazon and flipkart so that user doesn't need to check both website separately instead he can search the product here and we provide the description of the product . In addition to the description we also give the user the ability to pick a date and we show him the prediction of the price on that date(not that accurate yet but working on it) also we provide a graph of products price since it launched so that the user can get intuition of the price.

###### User can also read latest news on apple here.

#### Project is not finished yet but it works fine for comparing any apple products but the prediction and graph are only availbale for iphone 7 as of now but we will keep on updating the website
